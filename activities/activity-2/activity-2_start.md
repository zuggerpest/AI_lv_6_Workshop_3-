## 📋 Expected Outputs
You will add Python code to an incomplete function so that two unit tests pass.

## 📝 Step 2 – TDD Cycle 1 (🔴 Red → 🟢 Green)
Continue working in the same notebook from your previous cycle.

**💻 Cell 3 – Create function and tests**

Create a new Code cell containing the following:

```python
def should_upsell(order: dict) -> bool:
    """Predict if a customer will buy a drink."""
    return None  # start with a failing stub (RED)


# Positive test – loyalty at lunch → True
order_1a = {"time_of_day": "lunch", "loyalty_member": "yes"}
assert should_upsell(order_1a) is True, "FAIL: Loyalty at lunch should be upsold."
print("PASS: Test 1a")

# Negative test – non-loyalty at lunch → False (prevents `return True`)
order_1b = {"time_of_day": "lunch", "loyalty_member": "no"}
assert should_upsell(order_1b) is False, "FAIL: Non-loyalty at lunch should NOT be upsold."
print("PASS: Test 1b")
```

This code codes a function `should_upsell()` and two unit tests. The unit tests are correct but the function is incomplete. This shows the essence of practical TDD: write your test(s) *first*, then write the logic to pass the tests.

Run the code and note that you receive an `AssertionError`. This means that one or more of your unit tests aren't passing. This is due to the incomplete function.

Your task is to modify the code in the `should_upsell()` function so that the tests pass. You can re-run the same Code cell regularly to test your code.

✅ **Checkpoint:** You'll know you've succeeded when the output is:

```
PASS: Test 1a
PASS: Test 1b
```

## 💡 Hints
- 🤔 **Reflect:** What's the smallest logic that barely passes both tests?
- Try to fix one test at a time and build up the logic.
- What are the essential features of your function? What is the argument? What is the argument's type? What is the type of the return value?
